# Vue JS Invoice App

- This app is for a firm that trains students with their courses & get them placed.
- Four of the courses are free but if the student wants to avail more than 4 courses, they need to pay.
- This app is just for my practice on Vue JS. 
- I made a Search box at the top where the user is able to search for their courses & then they have a filter section where they can filter on the basis of date.
- Then there is a list of invoices, which on click shows the full invoice in the form of PDF.
