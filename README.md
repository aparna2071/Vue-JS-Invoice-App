# Vue JS Invoice App

- This app is for a firm that offers courses to students & help them get placed.
- Four of the courses are free but if students want to access more than 4 courses, they need to pay.
- In this app, I created a Search box at the top where the users can search for courses, then they have a filter section & an Invoice section.
- There is a list of Invoices, which on click shows the full invoice in the form of PDF.
